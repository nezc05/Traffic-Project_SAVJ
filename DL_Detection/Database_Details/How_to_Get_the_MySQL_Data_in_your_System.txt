There are two ways to do it, one is short way , on is long way.

SHORT way

1-Open the Command prompt in you system
2- copy the file named "TrafficProjectSchema.sql"  to Your CWD (Current Working Directory)
   ( or you can make your CWD as this directory)
3- then write the following code:
    " mysql -u [username] -p [New_database_name] < [input_file.sql] "
e.g " mysql -u root -p TrafficProjectFinal < TrafficProjectSchema.sql "

4- Make sure that , before u run this command the "New_database_name" i.e "TrafficProjectFinal" should already be created in your MySQL system.
  i.e run this command in MySQL shell before running the above command in command prompt
      " create database TrafficProjectFinal; "
    


LONG way

1-create a new database in your MySQL system with the following name.
 run the following command in MySQL shell.

 e.g. " create database TrafficProjectDatabase; "
 then " use TrafficProjectDatabase; "

2- now copy paste the code in the file "TrafficProjectFinalSchema_MysqlCode.txt" to mysql shell after running the above code.
Note: it is possible that if you try to copy paste all the 6 tables then it will only execute for first few tables and leave the last one, if that happens then copy paste the tables individually which were not executed

3- Now the table structure is created in the database, now we need to fill the data.
4- To fill the data run the python File named "EntringDataFromExcelToMysqltable.py" in "CodeHelp" Folder

5- make sure to change the parameters like the "excel_file_path" and user and password details of the MySQL databse according to your system. 

6- Once you run the python file data shd be added in the MySQL from excel.
